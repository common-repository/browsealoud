Websites made more accessible with easy speech, reading and translation tools.

== Description ==

= Add speech, reading and translation support to your website or blog with the ReachDeck Toolbar =

Want to provide a better experience for your website or blog visitors?

Millions of people can’t understand the information on your website or blog site - they can with the ReachDeck Toolbar.

Our innovative support software, ReachDeck, helps to reduce the barriers between your content and your audiences by adding speech, reading and translation to your website or blog site.  This support helps you reach a much wider audience - such as those with dyslexia, low literacy, mild visual impairments or where English is a second language.

= What does the ReachDeck Toolbar do? =

**Text-to-speech**: makes online services and information more accessible with a choice of read aloud voices, different reading speeds and highlighters to enhance understanding.

**Translation**: translates web pages into 99 languages and can read aloud 40 of the most commonly used languages including Spanish and Chinese.

**MP3 Creation**: instantly converts online content into audio versions for easy offline listening.

**Screen Masking**: blocks online clutter - letting the user focus on the text they want to read.

**Web Page Simplifier**: removes distracting content creating a simple format for online information - ideal for those with dyslexia, cognitive or learning disabilities.

**Custom Settings**: users can tailor the settings to suit their individual needs and preferences.
